This University was named after Late Dr.C.N.Annadurai, former Chief Minister \\nof Tamil Nadu.   It offers higher education in Engineering, Technology, Architecture and \\nApplied Sciences rel evant to  the current and projected needs of the society. B esides \\npromoting research and disseminating knowledge gained therefrom, it fosters cooperation \\nbetween the academic and industrial communities. \\n \\n \\nThe University was formed by bringing together and integrating four well known \\ntechnical institutions in the city of Madras (now Chennai) namely, \\n \\n \\nCollege of Engineering                            (CEG) (Established in 1794) \\nAlagappa College of Technology            (ACT) (Established in 1944) \\nMadras Institute of Technology               (MIT)  (Established in 1949) \\nSchool of Architecture & Planning           (SAP) (Established in 1957) \\n \\n \\nThe University is situated in the southern part of the city of Chennai and it is 3 kms. \\nfrom  the  nearest  Railway  Station  (Guindy)  and  10  kms. from  Chennai  Airport.    The \\nUniversity's Main Campus extends over 189 acres abutting the Adyar River on the north \\nand Raj Bhavan on the south.
